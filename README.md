Power back up for routers 12V@2A
Alot of people are facing sudden power cuts these days which ruins the flow of work from home.
Thus I have developed a power back up board that is able to switch from Vext to Vbat with almost 0ms delay and thus preventing from sudden power loss to the router.
I have set the battry charge current to 8.2V 600mA. The battries used are Li-ion 3200 mAh thus to avoid all sorts of risks I have kept the voltage low.
The estimated running time is 3-4 hours majorly depending on the routers model.
